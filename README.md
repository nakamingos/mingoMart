Mingo Mart is an open source platform for trading ethscriptions on the Ethereum blockchain. The project consists of three main components: a marketplace frontend, smart contracts, and an indexer service.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

IMPORTANT: The smart contracts in this repository are experimental and have not been audited. They come with absolutely no security guarantees. The contracts and other parts of the codebase are not guaranteed to be secure and should be considered experimental in nature. The code can change at any time without prior notice. Users interact with this codebase entirely at their own risk.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into three main directories:

### 1. Marketplace (`/marketplace`)
An Angular-based frontend application that provides an interface for:

- **Marketplace Features**:
  - Buy, sell & trade curated ethscription collections
  - Advanced filtering and search capabilities
  - Real-time price tracking and market data

- **Social Features**:
  - In-app chat system
  - Comments and discussions
  - User activity tracking
  - Leaderboard system
  - Notifications system

- **Technical Features**:
  - IPFS integration for content storage
  - Progressive Web App (PWA) support
  - GraphQL integration
  - State management system
  - Custom pipes and directives

### 2. Contracts (`/contracts`)
Smart contracts written in Solidity that power the Mingo Mart ecosystem:
- Core marketplace functionality
- Bridge contracts for cross-chain operations
- Utility contracts for points and rewards
- Governance and administration features

Built with:
- Hardhat development environment
- OpenZeppelin contracts
- Comprehensive test suite
- Deployment scripts

### 3. Indexer (`/indexer`)
A NestJS-based backend service that:
- Indexes and processes ethscriptions following the [Ethscriptions Protocol](https://ethscriptions.com)
- Tracks marketplace events and activities
- Manages real-time data synchronization
- Provides API endpoints for the marketplace

Key features:
- Protocol-compliant ethscription processing
- Real-time block processing
- Queue-based event handling
- Bridge operation support
- WebSocket notifications

### 4. Supabase (`/supabase`)
Contains the database schema and configuration for the project's PostgreSQL database:

- **Database Schema**:
  - Tables for ethscriptions, listings, bids, auctions, and collections
  - Separate tables for mainnet and sepolia testnet
  - User management and authentication tables
  - Event tracking and activity logs
  - Leaderboard and points system

- **Stored Procedures**:
  - Functions for fetching ethscriptions with listings and bids
  - Pagination and filtering utilities
  - Volume and sales calculations
  - User activity tracking
  - Address verification and holder checks

- **Configuration**:
  - Database configuration settings
  - Migration scripts
  - Data seeding utilities

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v20 or higher)
- Yarn package manager
- Redis (for indexer)
- Supabase (for data storage)
- IPFS (for content storage)

### Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies for each component:
   ```bash
   # Marketplace
   cd marketplace
   yarn install

   # Contracts
   cd ../contracts
   yarn install

   # Indexer
   cd ../indexer
   yarn install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in each directory
   - Update with your specific configuration

4. Start development servers:
   ```bash
   # Marketplace
   cd marketplace
   yarn start:mainnet # or yarn start:sepolia

   # Indexer
   cd ../indexer
   yarn start:dev
   ```

## Deployment

Each component has its own deployment process:

### Marketplace
```bash
cd marketplace
yarn build
# Deploy to your hosting service
```

### Contracts
```bash
cd contracts
yarn hardhat deploy --network <network>
```

### Indexer
```bash
cd indexer
yarn build
yarn engage
```
